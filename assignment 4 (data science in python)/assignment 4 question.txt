## Question 1
Returns a DataFrame of towns and the states they are in from the university_towns.txt list. 
The format of the DataFrame should be: DataFrame( [ ["Michigan", "Ann Arbor"], ["Michigan", "Yipsilanti"] ], columns=["State", "RegionName"]  )

The following cleaning needs to be done:
1. For "State", removing characters from "[" to the end.
2. For "RegionName", when applicable, removing every character from " (" to the end.
3. Depending on how you read the data, you may need to remove newline character '\n'. '''

## Question 2
Returns the year and quarter of the recession start time as a string value in a format such as 2005q3'''.

Returns the year and quarter of the recession end time as a string value in a format such as 2005q3'''.

Returns the year and quarter of the recession bottom time as a string value in a format such as 2005q3'''

## Question 3
Converts the housing data to quarters and returns it as mean values in a dataframe. This dataframe should be a dataframe with columns for 2000q1 through 2016q3, 
and should have a multi-index in the shape of ["State","RegionName"].  
Note: Quarters are defined in the assignment description, they are not arbitrary three month periods.
The resulting dataframe should have 67 columns, and 10,730 rows.

## Question 4 
First creates new data showing the decline or growth of housing pricesbetween the recession start and the recession bottom. 
Then runs a ttestcomparing the university town values to the non-university towns values, return whether the alternative hypothesis (that the two groups are the same) is true or not as well as the p-value of the confidence. 
Return the tuple (different, p, better) where different=True if the t-test is True at a p<0.01 (we reject the null hypothesis), or different=False if otherwise (we cannot reject the null hypothesis). 
The variable p should be equal to the exact p value returned from scipy.stats.ttest_ind(). 
The value for better should be either "university town" or "non-university town" depending on which has a lower mean price ratio (which is equivilent to a reduced market loss).'''
