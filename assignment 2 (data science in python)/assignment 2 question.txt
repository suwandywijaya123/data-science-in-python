PART 1

The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry on [All Time Olympic Games Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), and does some basic data cleaning. 
The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals, # of Winter games, Winter medals, total # number of games, total # of medals. Use this dataset to answer the questions below.


### Question 1

Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?
This function should return a single string value.


### Question 2
Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?
This function should return a single string value.


### Question 3
Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal counts relative to their total gold medal count? 
((summer gold- winter gold)/ total gold))
Only include countries that have won at least 1 gold in both summer and winter.
This function should return a single string value.


### Question 4
Write   function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal (`Gold.2`) counts for 3 points, silver medals (`Silver.2`) for 2 points, and bronze medals (`Bronze.2`) for 1 point. 
The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created, with the country names as indices.
This function should return a Series named `Points` of length 146*


PART 2
For the next set of questions, we will be using census data from the [United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov). 
Counties are political and geographic subdivisions of states in the United States. This dataset contains population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015. 
[See this document](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts/2010-2015/co-est2015-alldata.pdf) for a description of the variable names.
The census dataset (census.csv) should be loaded as census_df. Answer questions using this as appropriate.


### Question 5
Which state has the most counties in it? (hint: consider the sumlevel key carefully! You'll need this for future questions too...)
This function should return a single string value.*


### Question 6
Only looking at the three most populous counties for each state**, what are the three most populous states (in order of highest population to lowest population)? Use `CENSUS2010POP`.
This function should return a list of string values.*


### Question 7
Which county has had the largest absolute change in population within the period 2010-2015? (Hint: population values are stored in columns POPESTIMATE2010 through POPESTIMATE2015, you need to consider all six columns.)
e.g. If County Population in the 5 year period is 100, 120, 80, 105, 100, 130, then its largest change in the period would be |130-80| = 50.
This function should return a single string value.*


### Question 8
In this datafile, the United States is broken up into four regions using the "REGION" column. 
Create a query that finds the counties that belong to regions 1 or 2, whose name starts with 'Washington', and whose POPESTIMATE2015 was greater than their POPESTIMATE 2014.
This function should return a 5x2 DataFrame with the columns = ['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'] and the same index ID as the census_df (sorted ascending by index).*
